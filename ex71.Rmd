```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

#### A. Set Up

1. Load the `tidyverse`, `haven`, `ipumsr`, `ggeffects`, `ggfortify` and `broom` packages

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
library(ipumsr)
library(ggeffects)
library(ggfortify)
library(broom)
```

2. Read in the `ipumsi_mys.dta`
```{r}
d0 <- read_dta("C:/Users/18800/Desktop/stat model/data/ipumsi_mys.dta")
```

3. Create the `mis_lab` object based on the exercise from last week
```{r}
mis_labs <- c("unknown", 
              "niu (not in universe)",
              # age
              "not reported/missing", 
              # marst and nativity
              "unknown/missing")
```

4. Create an data frame object `d1` that 
    a. removes the detailed variables `marstd, religiond, edattaind, empstatd` columns
    b. removes the labels that are not in the data from labelled columns (using `lbl_clean()` function in the ipumsr package)
    c. converts values to NA when the labels are indicating the values are missing. 
    d. converts `age` and `age_sp` variable to numeric values based on their codes.
    e. converts the remaining labelled variables to factors. 

```{r}
d1 <- d0 %>%
  select(-ends_with("d")) %>%
  mutate_if(is.labelled, lbl_clean) %>%
  mutate_if(is.labelled, funs(lbl_na_if(., ~.lbl %in% mis_labs))) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(age, age_sp), zap_labels) %>%
  mutate_if(is.labelled, as_factor)
d1
```

5. Use the `sf` package to load the shape file `geo2_my1970_2000.shp`. 

```{r}
library(sf)
s0 <- read_sf("C:/Users/18800/Desktop/stat model/data/geo2_my1970_2000/geo2_my1970_2000.shp")
s0
```

6. Create data frame `s1` that has
    a. a new column `geolev2` that is a numeric version of the `GEOLEVEL2` column. 
    b. a new column `region` that is a factor based on `ADMIN_NAME`
    c. has no `geometry` column, hint: use `st_set_geometry(NULL)`
    d. has on the `geolev2` and `region` variable remaining

```{r}
s1 <- s0 %>%
mutate(geolev2 = as.numeric(GEOLEVEL2), 
         region = fct_inorder(ADMIN_NAME)) %>%
  st_set_geometry(NULL) %>%
  select(geolev2, region)
s1
```



#### B. Data to predict age of husbands ages, for females in their 20s living with children in 2000

1. Create a data set to model `d2` from `d1` that 
    a. filters to year 2000, for females in their 20s, that are married, and living in a household (`hhtype`) that is `married/cohab couple with children`
    b. has a new column `region` taken from joining `s2`
    c. has new column `husband_age` for the husbands age (hint: husbands age is in column `age_sp`)
    d. has a new column `age_sp` to transform the wife age to the number of years above 20. This will make interpretation of model intercepts easier.
    e. the number of children in the household (hint: number of people in the household is in the column `persons`)
    f. selects the husband_age, wife_age20, children, religion, urban, nativity, edattain and region columns
    g. drops any rows with `NA` and any levels not used in the categorical variables.

```{r}
d2 <- d1 %>%
  filter(year == 2000,
         sex == "female",
         age >= 20, age < 30,
         marst== "married/in union",
         hhtype == "married/cohab couple with children") %>%
  left_join(s1) %>%
  mutate(husband_age = age_sp,
         wife_age20 = age - 20,
         children = persons - 2) %>%
  select(husband_age, wife_age20,children, religion, urban, nativity, edattain, region) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  droplevels()
d2
head(d1)
```

2. Take a look at the summary statistics of each variable

```{r}
summary(d2)
```

3. Plot a  density chart for our outcome variable `husband_age` minus the `wifes_age`, include a vertical line at zero, to 

```{r}
ggplot(data = d2, 
       mapping = aes(x = husband_age - (wife_age20 + 20))) +
  geom_density() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0)
```

5. Q: From the plot and summary above find the mean and maximum husband age

A: Mean is 12, Maximum is 78

6. Plot a density chart for our outcome variable `husband_age` in each region

```{r}
ggplot(data = d2, 
       mapping = aes(x = husband_age - (wife_age20 + 20), group = region)) +
  geom_density() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0)

```



#### C. Standard linear regression models to predict age of husbands ages, for females in their 20s living with children in 2000

1. Fit a regression model to the data from 2000, with `husband_age` as the outcome variable and `wife_age20` and `children` as predictor variables. Store the results in an object `m`` and use the display function to show a summary of the model (without loading the arm package)

```{r}
m1 <- lm(husband_age ~ wife_age20 + children, data = d2)
summary(m1)
```

2. Use the `update()` function to add the following terms to the model:
  
    a. `region`
    b. `edattain`, `nativity`, `urban`
    
Save new models from each update as separate objects. 
Use the `display()` function to show the final model (`m3`).
    
```{r}
m2 <- update(object = m1, . ~ . + region)

m3 <- update(object = m2, . ~ . + edattain + nativity + edattain)
arm::display(m3)
```

#### D. Model Assesment

1. Use the `autoplot()` function in ggfortify to check the residuals of `m4`

```{r}
autoplot(m3)
```

2. Use the numbers in the model assessment plots to find individuals that are outliers. What do they have in common?

```{r}
d2 %>%
  slice(c(6081, 6677, 5711))
```

A: They husband are very old (over 60)

3. Use the ggpredict to plot the predicted relationship between the outcome variable and wife age for families with 2 children

```{r}
ggpredict(model = m3, terms = c("wife_age20", "children[2]")) %>%
  plot()
```

4. Use the ggpredict to plot the predicted relationship between the outcome variable and wife age for families with 2 children for all regions.

```{r}
ggpredict(model = m3, terms = c("wife_age20", "children[2]","region")) %>%
  plot()
```

5. Use the ggpredict to plot the predicted relationship between the outcome variable and wife age for families with 2 children for the Larut Dan Matang, Rembau, Port Dickson regions

```{r}
ggpredict(model = m3, 
          terms = c("wife_age20", 
                    "edattain[less than primary completed, university completed]", 
                    "region[Larut Dan Matang, Rembau, Port Dickson]")
          ) %>%
  plot() 
```

#### D. Multilevel/Hierarchical regression models to predict age of husbands ages, for females in their 20s living with children in 2000

1. Using the `lme4` package, fit the same regression model as `m2`, except with region as a varying intercept term. Save the results in object `m4` and show parameter estimates using the `display` function

```{r}
library(lme4)
m4 <- lmer(husband_age ~ wife_age20 + children + (1 | region), data = d2)
arm::display(m4)
```

2. Provide a brief summary for each of the sets of the parameters in the plot above

*Intercept* 25.70 

*wife_age20* 0.58 

*children*  1.04 

2. Show just the fixed effects (non-varying) terms using the `fixef` term.

```{r}
fixef(m4)
```

3. Show just the random effects (varying) terms using the `ranef` term

```{r}
ranef(m4)
```

4. Create a group level predictor variable for the sex ration in each region by 
    a. Joining `s1` to `d1``
    b. grouping by region
    c. filtering to year 2000
    d. creating a summary count for 
        i. the number of males between 20 and 39
        ii. the number of females between 20 and 39
        iii. the sex ratio based on 100 * men/women
    
```{r}
d3 <- d1 %>%
  left_join(s1) %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  filter(year == 2000) %>%
  summarise(
    men = sum(sex %in% "male" & age >= 20 & age < 40),
    women = sum(sex %in% "female" & age >= 20 & age < 40),
    region_sex_ratio = 100 * men/women
  )
d3
```
  
5. Join the group level predictors to `d2`, store in a new data frame `d4`

```{r}
d4 <- left_join(d2, d3)
d4
```


6. Update model `m4` to include the predictor `region_sex_ratio`

```{r}
m5 <- update(object = m4, . ~ . + region_sex_ratio, data = d4)
arm::display(m5)
```

7. Q: Provide some interpretation for the `region_sex_ratio` parameter

A: #####

### E. Model Comparisons

1. Build a tibble to compare the five models by 
    a. creating a list contain the five models
    b. converting the list to a tibble with a column `model` containing all the models
    c. add a column for the `model_name`
    d. add a data frame with the results of the `glance` function applied to each model
    e. drop the `model` column
    f. unnest the tibble to show

```{r}
list(m1, m2, m3, m4, m5) %>%
  tibble(model = .) %>%
  mutate(model_name = 1:n(),
         stats = map(model, glance)) %>%
  select(-model) %>%
  unnest()
```

2. Compare the AIC and BIC of the models. Which are the best models according to these criteria?
