```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

#### A. Set Up

1. Load the `tidyverse`, `haven`, `ipumsr`, `ggeffects`, `ggfortify` and `broom` packages

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
library(ipumsr)
library(ggeffects)
library(ggfortify)
library(broom)
```

2. Read in the `ipumsi_mys.dta`
```{r}
d0 <- read_dta("C:/Users/18800/Desktop/stat model/data/ipumsi_00013.dta")
```

3. Create the `mis_lab` object based on the exercise from last week
```{r}
mis_labs <- c("unknown", 
              "niu (not in universe)",
              # age
              "not reported/missing", 
              # marst and nativity
              "unknown/missing")
```

4. Create an data frame object `d1` that 
    a. selects the `geolev1, year, age, marst, urban, edattain, religion, nativity` columns
    b. removes the labels that are not in the data from labelled columns (using `lbl_clean()` function in the ipumsr package)
    c. converts values to NA when the labels are indicating the values are missing. 
    d. converts `age` variable to numeric values based on their codes.
    e. converts the remaining labelled variables to factors. 

```{r}
d1 <- d0 %>%
  select(geo1_ec2010,  year, sex,chborn, age, marst,  edattain, nativity) %>%
  mutate_if(is.labelled, lbl_clean) %>%
  mutate_if(is.labelled, funs(lbl_na_if(., ~.lbl %in%  mis_labs))) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(age,chborn), zap_labels) %>%
  mutate_if(is.labelled,  as_factor)
  
d1
summary(d1)
```

#### B. Data to predict number of children born in Kula Lumpar in 1970

1. Create an data frame object `d2` from `d1` that 
    a. filters to female between 15 and 45 in Kula Lumpa (geoleve1 code of 458010) in 1970
    b. create a `age10` variable for the age in units of decades
    c. drop the `geolev1`, `year`, `sex` and `age` columns
    d. drop rows with `NA` observations in one of the observations

```{r}
d2 <- d1 %>%
  filter(geo1_ec2010 == "pichincha", 
          sex == "female", 
          age >= 15, age <= 45) %>%
  mutate( age10 = age/10) %>%
  select(-(geo1_ec2010:sex), -age) %>%
   na.omit()
d2
```

2. Take a look at the summary statistics of each variable

```{r}
summary( d2)
```

3. Plot a bar chart for the future outcome variable `chborn`

```{r}
ggplot(data = d2, 
       mapping = aes(x = chborn)) +
  geom_bar()

```

4. Q: From the plot and summary above find the mean and median number of children born 

A: Mean   : 1.443  Median : 1.000

#### C. Models to predict number of children born in Kula Lumpar in 1970

1. Fit a regression model to the data from 1970, with `chborn` as the outcome variable and `age10` as predictor variables. Store the results in an object `m0` and use the display function to show a summary of the model (without loading the arm package)

```{r}
m0 <- glm(formula = chborn ~ age10, data = d2, family = "poisson")
arm::display(m0)
```

2. Use the `update()` function to add the following terms to the model:
  
    a. `marst`
    b. `edattain`
    
    e. `nativity`

    
  Save new models from each update as separate objects. 
  Use the `display()` function to show the final model (`m6`).

```{r}
m1 <- update(object = m0, . ~ . + marst)

m2 <- update(object = m1, . ~ . + edattain)


m3 <- update(object = m2, . ~ . + nativity)

m4 <- update(object = m3, . ~ . + nativity*edattain)
m5 <- update(object = m3, . ~ . + nativity*marst)
m6 <- update(object = m3, . ~ . + nativity*age10)
arm::display(m6)

```
3. Use summary to show the t-tests for each parameters (of the null hypothesis that their value is zero) for the final model `m6`

```{r}
summary(m6)
```
4. Simple t-tests are not very useful for building models when we have categorical data. Use the `anova()` function to compare the deviance statistics from model `m0` and `m1`.

```{r}
anova(m0, m1)
```

5. Set the test argument to `Chisq` in the `anova()` function to test for the inclusion of the `marst` categorical variable

```{r}
anova(m0, m1, test = "Chisq")
```

6. Carry out a series of `Chisq` tests in the `anova()` function to test for the expansion of our series of nested models.

```{r}
anova(m0, m1, m2, m3, m4,m5,m6, test = "Chisq")
```
7. Q: Do these test suggest dropping any terms?

A: Evidence to suggest the additional deviance reduction from the `nativity:urban` interaction is close to zero, so could drop this term.  model6

8. Use the `glance()` function to find the AIC and BIC model statistics from model `m0` and model `m5`

```{r}
glance(m0)
glance(m6)
```

9. Create a tibble that contains 
    a. a column of lists containing all the models
    b. a column of numbers of the model names
    c. a data frame with the results of the glance function applied to each model

```{r}
m <- list(m0 = m0,
          m1 = m1,
          m2 = m2,
          m3 = m3,
          m4 = m4,
          m5 = m5,
          m6 = m6
       ) %>%
  tibble(model = .) %>%
  mutate(model_name = 0:6,
         stats = map(model, glance))
m
```

10. Using `m` display the AIC and BIC from each model by 
    a. Removing the model column
    b. Use the `unnest()` function to give the contents of the glance function as data values
    c. Select the `model_name`, `AIC` and `BIC` columns

```{r}
 m %>%
  select(-model) %>%
  unnest() %>%
  select(model_name, AIC, BIC)

```

11. Q: Which model has the lowest AIC and BIC? What does this mean?

A: model 3. The BIC penalizes the model more for having extra parameters. 


#### D. Model Assesment

1. Use the `autoplot()` function in ggfortify to check the residuals of `m4`

```{r}
autoplot(m3)
```

2. Using `ggpredict()` show the change over `age10` in the predicted number of children by education and marital status from model `m4`

```{r}
ggpredict(model = m3, terms = c("age10", "edattain", "marst")) %>%
  plot()
```

3. Using `ggpredict()` show the change over `age10` in the predicted number of children by education and urban location from model `m4`

```{r}
ggpredict(model = m4, terms = c("age10", "edattain", "nativity")) %>%
  plot()
```
