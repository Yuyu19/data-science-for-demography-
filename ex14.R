# 1. Create a vector called a1 for the 1, 4, 9, 16, 25

# 2. Create a vector called a2 from 1 to 100

# 3. Create a vector called a3 from -8 to 20 in steps of 4

# 4. Create a vector called a4 that combines a1 and a3

# 5. Create a vector called a5 that has your first and last name repeated 3 times

# 6. Find the square root of each element in a1

# 7. Test to see where a3 are positive (greater than zero)

# 8. Divide a2 by a1. Then divide a2 by a3. What is going on?
